RethinkDB 2.4.2 has been released.  This update provides compilation
and bug fixes for the latest Linux and MacOS systems and includes one
notable change:

* `r.js` now uses [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) instead of
  [V8](https://v8.dev/) 3.30.33.

QuickJS supports a much newer version of JavaScript, and this update
will both reduce RethinkDB's future maintenance burden and make it
easier for new contributors to work on the project.  If you use
`r.js`, your queries' behavior could hypothetically change.

For a complete list of changes in this update, you can refer to
theÂ [release
notes](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/v2.4.x/NOTES.md).

## Packages

Packages are available for x86-64 Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS 7, AlmaLinux
8, RockyLinux 8, and MacOS.  Linux ARM builds are supposed to be
released soon.  While RethinkDB does build on Apple M1 systems, a dmg
will only be available for x86-64.  If you want a package made
available for your system, find us on
[Slack](http://slack.rethinkdb.com/),
[Discord](http://discord.rethinkdb.com/), or
[GitHub](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues) and make your
needs known.
