# Open Governance Model

## Overview

Anyone with an interest in RethinkDB can join the community,
contribute to RethinkDB design and participate in the decision-making process.
This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about
earning merit within the RethinkDB community.

## Roles and responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for RethinkDB. They are the most important
members of the community and without them, RethinkDB would have no purpose. Anyone can
be a user; there are no special requirements.
RethinkDB asks its users to participate in RethinkDB and community as much as possible.
User contributions enable RethinkDB team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs
of those users. Common user contributions include (but are not limited to):

* evangelizing about RethinkDB (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)
* informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
* providing moral support
* providing financial support

Users who continue to engage with RethinkDB and its community will often become more and
more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming Contributors, as described in the
next section.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to RethinkDB. Anyone can
become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms, as detailed in a separate
document. There is no expectation of commitment to RethinkDB, no specific skill requirements,
and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves doing one or
more of the following:

* supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new users)
* reporting bugs
* identifying requirements
* providing graphics and web design
* programming assisting with project infrastructure
* writing documentation
* fixing bugs
* adding features

Contributors engage with RethinkDB through the issue tracker, and writing or editing documentation.
They submit changes to RethinkDB itself via patches, which will be considered for inclusion in
RethinkDB by existing committers (see next section). The developer Slack channel is the most
appropriate place to ask for help when making that first contribution.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with RethinkDB, their profile within, and commitment
to, the community will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves being nominated for committers.

## Committers

Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of
RethinkDB through ongoing engagement with the community. Committership allows contributors to more easily
carry on with their project-related activities by giving them direct access to RethinkDB’s resources.
That is, they can make changes directly to project outputs, without having to submit changes via patches

This does not mean that a committer is free to do what they want. In fact, committers have no more
authority over RethinkDB than contributors. While Committership indicates a valued member of the community
who has demonstrated a healthy respect for RethinkDB’s aims and objectives, their work continues to be
reviewed by the community before acceptance in an official release. The key difference between a committer
and a contributor is when this approval is sought from the community. A committer seeks approval after the
contribution is made, rather than before.

Seeking approval after making a contribution is known as a commit-then-review process. It is more efficient
to allow trusted people to make direct contributions, as the majority of those contributions will be accepted
by RethinkDB. RethinkDB employs various communication mechanisms to ensure that all contributions are reviewed
by the community as a whole. By the time a contributor is invited to become a committer, they will have become
familiar with RethinkDB’s various tools as a user and then as a contributor.

Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and
ability to participate in RethinkDB as a team player. Typically, a potential committer will need to show that
they have an understanding of RethinkDB, its objectives, and its strategy. They will also have provided valuable
contributions to RethinkDB over a period of time.

New committers can be nominated by any existing committer. Once they have been nominated, there will be a
vote by the RethinkDB management committee (PMC; see below). Committer voting is one of the few activities
that take place on RethinkDB’s private management list. This is to allow PMC members to freely express their
opinions about a nominee without causing embarrassment. Once the vote has been held, the aggregated voting
results are published on the website. The nominee is entitled to request an explanation of any ‘no’ votes against
them, regardless of the outcome of the vote. This explanation will be provided by the PMC Chair (see below) and
will be anonymous and constructive in nature.

Nominees may decline their appointment as a committer. However, this is unusual, as RethinkDB does not expect any
specific time or resource commitment from its community members. The intention behind the role of committer is to
allow people to contribute to RethinkDB more easily, not to tie them into RethinkDB in any formal way.

It is important to recognize that Committership is a privilege, not a right. That privilege must be earned and once
earned it can be removed by the PMC (see next section) in extreme circumstances. However, under normal circumstances,
Committership exists for as long as the committer wishes to continue engaging with RethinkDB.

A committer who shows an above-average level of contribution to RethinkDB, particularly with respect to its strategic
direction and long-term health, may be nominated to become a member of the PMC. This role is described below.

## Project Management Committee

RethinkDB management committee consists of those individuals identified as ‘project owners’ on the development and community
side. The PMC has additional responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These responsibilities ensure the smooth
running of RethinkDB. PMC members are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes
to the governance model and manage the copyrights within RethinkDB outputs.

Members of the PMC do not have significant authority over other members of the community, although it is the PMC that votes on
new committers. It also makes decisions when community consensus cannot be reached. In addition, the PMC has access to RethinkDB’s
private mailing list, Slack channels, and its archives. This communication platform is used for sensitive issues, such as votes
for new committers, legal matters, vulnerability reports and some strategic planning that cannot be discussed in public.

Membership of the PMC is by invitation from the existing PMC members. A nomination will result in discussion and then a vote by the
existing PMC members. PMC membership votes are subject to consensus approval of the current PMC members.

## PMC Chair

The PMC Chair is a single individual, voted for by the PMC members. Once someone has been appointed Chair, they remain in that role
until they choose to retire, or the PMC casts a two-thirds majority vote to remove them.

The PMC Chair has no additional authority over other members of the PMC: the role is one of coordinator and facilitator. The Chair is
also expected to ensure that all governance processes are adhered to and has the casting vote when RethinkDB fails to reach consensus.

## Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the RethinkDB management infrastructure.
This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognize that all support activity within
RethinkDB is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows.

## Decision-making process

Decisions about the future of RethinkDB are made through discussion with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most
experienced PMC member. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the RethinkDB contributors’ mailing list or Slack
channel. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on a private list or Slack channel.

In order to ensure that RethinkDB is not bogged down by endless discussion and continual voting, RethinkDB operates a policy of lazy consensus.

This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.

### Lazy consensus

Decision making typically involves the following steps:

* Proposal
* Discussion
* Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)
* Decision

Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should send a message to the RethinkDB contributors’ list, Slack channel or submit a patch implementing the idea to the issue tracker.
This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for
the contribution. Since most people in the RethinkDB community have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order
to reach consensus.

In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is recognized as having the support of the community. This is
called lazy consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have implicitly agreed to the implementation of the
proposal.
The lazy consensus is a very important concept within RethinkDB. It is this process that allows a large group of people to efficiently
reach consensus, as someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their position, and others need not spend time
reading such mails.

For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours (3 days) before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal. This time period
is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.

### Voting

Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of RethinkDB must gain explicit
approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is encouraged to express their opinions in all discussions and all votes. However, only project
committers and/or PMC members (as defined above) have binding votes for the purposes of decision making.
