Starting today, we're sponsoring $500 for the best content written about
RethinkDB during Pluralsight's [hack.guides() 2016 Tutorial
Contest](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/).

If you're not familiar with [hack.guides()](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/),
it's a developer community for writing technical guides. It's a great way to
collaborate with other writers and help spread your knowledge across a growing
open-source community!

What makes _the best RethinkDB content_ you ask? In this case, one-third of
your score is based on the number of hearts (or "likes") that your article
receives, one-third is based on the number of legitimate social shares of your
article, and one-third is determined by a panel of Pluralsight's API judges who
will gauge your writing style, effective use of technologies and APIs, ability
to communicate your point, and overall quality... no _Cs get degrees here_,
folks!

If you need help organizing your thoughts or want to run an idea by us, join
the #content channel at [slack.rethinkdb.com](http://slack.rethinkdb.com/) or
shoot us a tweet [@rethinkdb](https://twitter.com/rethinkdb). 

We're excited to read all of your entries...good luck!
