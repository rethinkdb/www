Today, we're happy to announce __RethinkDB 1.15__ ([Lawrence of Arabia][yt]).
[Download it now!][install]

[yt]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmr1iSG3RTA
[install]: /docs/install

The 1.15 release includes over [50 enhancements][] and introduces geospatial
queries to RethinkDB. This has been _by far_ the [most requested
feature][#1158] by RethinkDB users. In addition, we've sped up many queries
dramatically by lazily deserializing data from disk. This release also brings a
new [r.uuid][] command that allows server-side generation of UUIDs.

[r.uuid]: /docs/javascript/uuid

Thanks primarily to [Daniel Mewes][], RethinkDB now has rich geospatial features including:

- [r.geojson][] and [r.to_geojson][] for importing and exporting [GeoJSON][]
- Commands to create [points][], [lines][], [polygons][] and [circles][]
- Geospatial queries:
     - [get_intersecting][]: finds all documents that intersect with a given geometric object
     - [get_nearest][]: finds the closest documents to a point
- Geospatial indexes to make `get_intersecting` and `get_nearest` blindingly fast
- Functions that operate on geometry:
     - [r.distance][]: gets the distance between a point and another geometric object
     - [r.intersects][]: determines whether two geometric objects intersect
     - [r.includes][]: tests whether one geometric object is completely contained in another
     - [r.fill][]: converts a line into a polygon
     - [r.polygon_sub][]: subtracts one polygon from another

__Upgrading to RethinkDB 1.15?__

  - If you're upgrading from version 1.12 or earlier, you will need to [migrate
    your data][] one last time.
  - If you're coming from 1.13, you don't need to migrate your data but you may
    need to [recreate your indexes][].

[migrate your data]: /docs/migration/
[recreate your indexes]: /docs/troubleshooting/#my-secondary-index-is-outdated

__Upgrading on Ubuntu?__ If you're upgrading from 1.12 or earlier, first [set
up the new RethinkDB PPA][ubuntu].

# Using geospatial queries

Let's insert a couple of locations into RethinkDB:

```py
> r.table('geo').insert([
  {
    'id': 1,
    'name': 'San Francisco',
    'location': r.point(-122.423246, 37.779388)
  },
  {
    'id': 2,
    'name': 'San Diego',
    'location': r.point(-117.220406, 32.719464)
  }
]).run(conn)
```

Throughout RethinkDB, all coordinates are entered as longitude/latitude to be
consistent with GeoJSON.

In order for geospatial queries to return these points as results, we need to
create a geospatial index:

```py
> r.table('geo').createIndex('location', geo=True).run(conn)
```

Now, let's find which of these cities is nearest to a given point &mdash; for
example, [Santa Maria, CA][]:

[Santa Maria, CA]: https://goo.gl/maps/iRVWv

```py
> r.table('geo').get_nearest(
    r.point(-120.4333, 34.9514),  # Santa Maria's long/lat
    index='location',
    max_dist=300,
    unit='mi',
    max_results=1).run(conn)

[{"doc": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "San Francisco",
    "location": {
      "$reql_type$": "GEOMETRY",
      "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [-122.423246, 37.779388] }},
  "dist": 224.34241555826364 }]
```

We see that Santa Maria is about 224 miles from San Francisco. Note that
RethinkDB returns the matched document, as well as the distance to the original
point.

We can also find all geometric shapes that intersect with a polygon. This is
useful when you're given a viewing window, and need to return all geometry
that's inside the window:

```py
def query_view_window(top, bottom, left, right):
    # top and bottom are latitudes, left and right are longitudes
    bounding_box = r.polygon(
        r.point(left, top),
        r.point(right, top),
        r.point(right, bottom),
        r.point(left, bottom))
    return r.table('geo').get_intersecting(bounding_box, index='location').run(conn)
```

dynamically load street maps and points of interest.

# Faster queries #

Prior to the 1.15 release, every time a query touched a document RethinkDB
would pull the entire document from disk and deserialize it into a full ReQL
data structure in memory.

In RethinkDB 1.15, the database intelligently deserializes only portions of the
document when they become necessary. If a field isn't required by the query,
RethinkDB no longer spends time looking at it. This speeds up queries that only
need part of a document, most notoriously `count`.

You should see performance increases for:

- analytic queries which only need summary information
- queries which don't touch every part of a document.

In our (unscientific) tests, we saw performance improvements of around 15% for
simple read queries, &times;2 for analytic queries, and &times;50 for `count`
queries on tables. We'll be publishing scientific benchmarks soon, but in the
meantime, enjoy the better performance!

# Server-side UUIDs

The new `r.uuid` command lets you generate server-side UUIDs wherever you like.

Let's say that when you create a new player they get a default item in their
inventory. Additionally, each item needs a unique identifier:

```py
> r.table("player").insert({
      "name": player_name,
      "inventory": [{
          "item_type": "potion",
          "item_id": r.uuid(),
      }]
  }, non_atomic=True, return_changes=True).run(conn)
```

This will return:

```
{ "inserted": 1,
  "changes": [
    {
      "new_val": {
        "id": "063ab596-543e-45a7-904f-c3fafa96bf42",
        "name": "for_my_friends",
        "inventory": [{
          "item_type": "potion",
          "item_id": "e985d732-c2ac-40a4-bf19-9b4946632859",
        }]
      },
      "old_val": null
    }
}
```

RethinkDB has always created a UUID automatically for the primary key if it
isn't specified in the inserted document, but now we can generate UUIDs for
embedded documents as well. You can get the generated keys by using
`return_changes=True`.

Since UUID generation is random (and therefore can't be done atomically),
you'll need to add the `non_atomic=True` flag to any update or insert that uses
`r.uuid`.

The team is already hard at work on the upcoming [1.16 release][] that will
focus on more flexible changefeeds. As always, if there is something you'd like
us to prioritize or if you have any feedback on the release, please [let us
know][]!
